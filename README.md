# MalwareArchive

### Important
This GitHub repository contains a bunch of Win32 PE malware. These samples are public for those malware enthusiasts and testers (Especially YouTubers). It's strongly recommended **not** to test them on the host Operating System until you know what are you doing.

**I'm not responsible for any kind of issue whether it's legal or illegal by the publicity of this repo.**
